# Data Structure and Algorithms (STL style)

## Overall
./src is the  source code of my dst implementation, which is based on stl.

(detailed and efficient, actually more efficient than llvm-stl in osx).

filename start with prefix 'dst_' is the detailed implementation, otherwise is head file.

Usage: almost the same interface like stl.

```
#include "stddsa.h"
using namespace dsa;
```
./v1 is a simple and incomplete version of dst, its main purpose is for visualization.
